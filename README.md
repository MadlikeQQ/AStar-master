# A Star Pathfinding

This project is an implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.
Created as an assignment for  [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence] at [ntua].

Based on the free version of Aron Grandberg's implementation aimed at the Unity3D Engine
https://arongranberg.com/astar/

This version is not meant to work with Unity3D. The program produces output files that are then to be inserted as inputs in our other project [AIPathsGraphics].

Credits to Aron Grandberg for the free version of his A* Algorithm. We could not find a license for those so we suppore they are free of licenses.
